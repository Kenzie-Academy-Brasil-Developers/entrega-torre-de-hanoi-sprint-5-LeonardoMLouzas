# Tower of Hanoi

This is a mathematical disk game. The objective is to restock the disks in decreasing order, from the first tower to a different one, obeying the following rules:
1. Only one disk may be moved at a time;
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty tower;
3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it;

**This project was made for the Kenzie Academy Brasil bootcamp with help of my duo Beatriz.**
